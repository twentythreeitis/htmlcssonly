100 micro projects using HTML and CSS. 

Micro projects are not equivalent to any product clone or real web application. They are building block of code structures that must be mastered before diving into heavy development of real world applications. Polishing every bits of the fundamentals is what I look forward in this.

These micro projects includes 
1. Login Forms
2. Navigation Bars
3. Sidebar Menu
4. Card Designs
5. Search Bars
6. Clones (in the end)
