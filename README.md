# htmlcssonly
I am building 100 micro projects using only HTML and CSS. Micro projects are not equivalent to any product clone or real web application. They are buildig block of code structures that must be mastered before diving into heavy development of real world applications. Polishing every bits of the fundamentals is what I look forward in this.
